# 3DReconstruction_Heat-treatment-detection
Identification system for heat-treated workpieces based on 3D vision reconstruction

In the hardware design and construction scheme, considering that Astra Pro can achieve high-resolution and high-precision depth recovery and point cloud generation within the range of 0.6-8M, we have described a measurement space of 1x1x1.2M in the application scenario design. By arranging Astra Pro at the four corners to measure the middle object in all directions, we obtain the comprehensive point cloud of the object to be measured. Meanwhile, the hardware design can adjust the measurement height of the system by adjusting the installation height at the bottom to accommodate workpieces of different scales. The point cloud blocks generated by the four eye structured light are registered, concatenated, and processed by the later point cloud algorithm.
